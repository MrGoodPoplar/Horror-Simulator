# Game Description

A dark, narrative-driven psychological horror game inspired built in a low-poly visual style.

## Plot

You play as a young man trapped in a cursed, decaying town—a place that reflects the emptiness of routine and the spiritual weight of a lost purpose. Each day, you work a dead-end job, maintain your sanity, and uncover the twisted veins of a living, corrupted Heart buried within the city’s soul.

Your goal is not just to survive—but to change the Heart.

> “Everyone has the power to change a heart. But not everyone’s willing to.”

This game is about inner transformation, purpose, and sacrifice. You must sever the town’s black veins one by one, and reconnect them to something pure—ultimately facing the Heart itself.
